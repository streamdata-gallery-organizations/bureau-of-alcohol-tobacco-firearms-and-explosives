description: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF, BATF, and
  BATFE) is a federal law enforcement organization within the United States Department
  of Justice.[4] Its responsibilities include the investigation and prevention of
  federal offenses involving the unlawful use, manufacture and possession of firearms
  and explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal trafficking of alcohol and
  tobacco products. The ATF also regulates via licensing the sale, possession, and
  transportation of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce. Many
  of ATFs activities are carried out in conjunction with task forces made up of state
  and local law enforcement officers, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods. ATF operates
  a unique fire research laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, where full-scale mock-ups
  of criminal arson can be reconstructed.
