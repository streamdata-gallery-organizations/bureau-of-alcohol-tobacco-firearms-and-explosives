  description: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF, BATF,
    and BATFE) is a federal law enforcement organization within the United States
    Department of Justice.[4] Its responsibilities include the investigation and prevention
    of federal offenses involving the unlawful use, manufacture and possession of
    firearms and explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal trafficking of
    alcohol and tobacco products. The ATF also regulates via licensing the sale, possession,
    and transportation of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce.
    Many of ATFs activities are carried out in conjunction with task forces made up
    of state and local law enforcement officers, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods.
    ATF operates a unique fire research laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, where
    full-scale mock-ups of criminal arson can be reconstructed.
